At the **MetaConscious Group**, we study how to build functional models of brains, with a particular interest in cognition. The group is directed by Guangyu Robert Yang at MIT.
  
For the 2023/2024 academic year, the MetaConscious Group will not be accepting PhD program applications. Thank you for your interest

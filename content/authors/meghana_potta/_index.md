With 2+ years of full-stack software development under my belt, I transitioned into the world of neuroscience to reverse-engineer the brain so as to extract the underlying computational primitives. I am a Master's student at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at ETH Zurich & University of ZÃ¼rich, where I focus on the mathematical modeling of cognition. Currently, I am visiting the MetaConscious group to study neural dynamics.

If you are curious about what I do or have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

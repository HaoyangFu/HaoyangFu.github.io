Hi! I'm Katheryn, a research assistant with a background in computer science and bioengineering. After witnessing the ability of the brain to recover from traumatic injuries like strokes and surgery, I want to study how our brains are capable of such incredible transformations. 

I previously assisted at the Adesnik Lab at UC Berkeley working with two-photon calcium imaging data. Now I want to utilize my computational background to model the brain and its capabilities.

Feel free to email me if you would ever like to chat or ask questions!

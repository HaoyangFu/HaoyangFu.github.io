I am a service-minded, detail-oriented Postdoctoral Scientist with a strong background in physics and math. I have a profound passion for AI, especially in the areas of language and memory. My goal is to use AI to model the brain, hoping to develop brain-inspired learning principles to boost neural network performance. I am deeply committed to AI safety and its responsible advancement. I also aim to make AI more understandable, believing that this will help us learn and grow faster.

If you are interested in my research or other things I do ( https://naiimic.github.io ), don't hesitate to email me. I will be more than happy to chat.

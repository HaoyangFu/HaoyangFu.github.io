I am a first year PhD student at in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS). I am fascinated by the complexity of the human brain and its ability to achieve functions that still seem ethereal. 

My research is in Computational Neuroscience where I look to the biological brain for inspiration to develop novel technologies. 

My research interests range from augmenting existing brain-inspired technology (e.g. neural networks) with novel insights from experimental neuroscience to engineering transformative “neurotech" (e.g ex-vivo “brain-on-chip” neural compute, DNA storage & computation). 

Besides neuroscience, I am interested in exploring areas in biotechnology, especially natural computing and bioinformatics.

I am currently looking to recruit UROPs so please email me if you are interested in working with me!

I hold a B.S. in Computation and Cognition from MIT and am currently a second year PhD student at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I'm fascinated by the complexity of the human brain and its ability to achieve functions that still seem ethereal. My PhD research is in Computational Neuroscience, where I look to the biological brains of small organisms for inspiration to develop novel technologies. My research interests range from augmenting existing brain-inspired technology (e.g. neural networks) with the latest insights of experimental neuroscience, to the engineering of transformative neurotechnology (e.g. "brain-on-chip" devices). Besides neuroscience, I am also interested in exploring areas in biotechnology, especially natural computing and bioinformatics. I am open to career and academic opportunities in the aforementioned fields. I consume literature and especially enjoy reading fiction. I enjoy the occasional, mildly strenuous hike. I feel a great thrill when traveling and would like to visit many more countries in the future. I enjoy mentoring young researchers, especially URMs in STEM, so feel free to email me to ask about opportunities to work with me.

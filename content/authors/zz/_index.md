My ultimate research motivation is equipping AI models with empathy and socio-emotional awareness. I am currently exploring computational theory of mind, neural bases of empathic processes, and the functional role of moods in decision making, for the purposes of maximizing well-being in multi-agent environments.

Previously, I worked on projects exploring Bayesian inverse planning, applying pedagogical reasoning to safety-critical human-robot interactions, the role of conventions in human-AI collaboration, as well as real-time detection of traumatic brain injury.

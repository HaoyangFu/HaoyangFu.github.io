Neuroscience had stagnanted, and the recent surge in AI was both a breath of life and a storm. New tools and new paradigms bloomed. For the perfect primoridial soup, cognitive science is also increasingly becoming another essential tool. Despite the disorienting landscapes in between these fields, I firmly hold that the proper step forward in the study of intelligence means a step forward in neuroscience, cognitive science, and in machine learning.

You will probably find me at Cosyne, ICLR, NeurIPS or CCN. Would be happy to chat and collaborate.

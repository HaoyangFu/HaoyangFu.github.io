How does the brain learn? How to apply our knowledge of how the brain learns to help people learn and design intelligent machines that not only help us automate tasks but also help us learn and understand the complex world? My research is motivated by these questions.

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. There are many kinds of learning in machine learning terms, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Previous research has found links between these kinds of learning and biological processes in the brain. However, people mainly studied different types of learning separately. I am working on building integrated multi-systems models that account for how different types of learning happen and interact in distributed processes in the brain.

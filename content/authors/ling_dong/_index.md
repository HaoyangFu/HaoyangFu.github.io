I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before graduate school, I got my bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

I am particularly interested in several questions. For example, how does the brain learn, maintain, and manipulate mental abstractions about surroundings? How does the brain transform highly abstract plans into continuous high-dimensional motor output? How does intrinsic motivation guide learning? Currently, I am working with Prof. Robert Guangyu Yang on building artificial neural network models of working memory to investigate how we flexibly store and manipulate information.

I am a graduate student in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT. I am broadly interested in the intersection between the computational and neurosciences, that is: how can mathematical and computational methods be used to better understand the mind, and how can insights about the mind in turn be used to inform algorithmic and architectural solutions to modern computational challenges? My current focus lies on the cognitive map and how the brain performs abstraction for efficient knowledge representation and flexible inferences.

Previously, I worked on investigating strategies utilizing the unique social roles occupied by robots to elicit social facilitation and improve team dynamics in human-robot teams at the Yale Social Robotics Lab, and on public opinion forecasting as well as analyzing patterns of production and consumption in online news at Microsoft Research New York. More generally, I am interested in the applications of data science for social good, particularly in the fields of education and healthcare.
